<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Good day. 
  Over the course of this year, I believe I've done well with most of my work in this class. However, I realize there are areas where I could have spent more time and effort to get better results. Sometimes I didn't really try to push myself to improve my skills. I wish I had spent more time making my projects look better by adding more element to improve the style and workings of the pieces. I also wish I had taken more time on the labs and projects down the line to try out new ideas and techniques. This would have helped me learn more and create better work. Moving on, I plan to spend more time on my assignments, focusing on both how it works and how it looks. I want to keep improving by trying new tools and techniques, so my future projects are of higher quality and more creative.</p>
